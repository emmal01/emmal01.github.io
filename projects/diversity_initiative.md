summary: "With two friends, I spearheaded an initiative on the county level to diversify our English curriculum and improve classroom culture."
---

In the summer of 2020, unable to go about regular life, two friends and I organized discussions with students across our county surrounding our collective experiences in high school surrounding the hostile classroom culture we encountered in our English classes when covering topics of race, gender, and sexuality. Out of our shared experiences, we came up with a list of action items that we presented to Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS) and gave presentations to over 30 English teachers at our former high schools. We made a video presentation on DEI that was later adopted in FCPS's annual teacher training.
